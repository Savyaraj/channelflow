Stop adjusting trust region and take a step because
Improvement is merely Poor, Ok, or Good : 0
Newton step is within trust region      : 1
Backup step is better                   : 0
Delta has reached local limit           : 0
Take current step and leave delta unchanged, for the following reasons:
improvement            : Accurate
