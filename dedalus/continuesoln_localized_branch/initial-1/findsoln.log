rH       ==   3.86409e-13 residual of newton/hookstep
Delta_rH ==  -8.17308e-12 actual improvement in residual from newton/hookstep

             -1.80066e-14 lower bound for acceptable improvement
             -8.29102e-13 upper bound for ok improvement.
             -6.21827e-12 upper bound for good improvement.
             -7.46192e-12 upper bound for accurate prediction.
Delta_rH ==  -8.17308e-12 ------> Accurate <------
             -9.12013e-12 lower bound for accurate prediction.
             -1.80066e-11 local linear model of improvement
lambda       == 0.915574 is the reduction/increase factor for delta suggested by quadratic model
lambda*delta == 0.00915574 is the delta suggested by quadratic model
Improvement is Accurate (some form of acceptable).
Stop adjusting trust region and take a step because
Improvement is merely Poor, Ok, or Good : 0
Newton step is within trust region      : 1
Backup step is better                   : 0
Delta has reached local limit           : 0
Take current step and leave delta unchanged, for the following reasons:
improvement            : Accurate
|newtonstep| <= delta  : true
delta >= deltaMax      : false
delta == 0.01
